## ðŸš€ Installation

### Option 1: Using Conda (Recommended)

It is recommended to create an isolated environment:

```bash
# Create a new environment
conda create -n medical-summarizer python=3.10

# Activate the environment
conda activate medical-summarizer

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


Option 2: Using Pip Only
pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Application
streamlit run app.py


ðŸ¤– Model
Uses Hugging Face Inference API with google/pegasus-xsum as the default summarization model.

Other supported models (easily switchable by changing API_URL inside summarizer.py):

t5-base

google/flan-t5-large

Important:

You do NOT need to download large models locally.

The app calls Hugging Face hosted models via API for efficiency.

ðŸ”‘ Important Note on Hugging Face API Token
For ease of testing, a free temporary Hugging Face API token has already been included directly in the summarizer.py file.
This token allows instructors and reviewers to run the application immediately without needing to create a new token.

Note:
This token will be revoked after grading.
